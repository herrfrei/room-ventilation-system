# System Status Communication

The controller communicates system status via MQTT messages to a MQTT broker.
For this to work, at least the IP address and MQTT broker address have to be
configured in UserConfig.hpp (see KWLConfig::NetworkIPAddress and
KWLConfig::NetworkMQTTBroker). Network gateway address as well as DNS and NTP
server are derived from IP address by replacing the last octet with 1.


## Status MQTT Topics

Following status topics are defined:

NOTE: MQTT topics will be changed in the future to harmonize the language used
(with legacy topic compatibility).


## Heartbeat

The controller sends a heartbeat message once every 30s (by default, it can be configured
or turned off using KWLConfig::HeartbeatPeriod). This message either contains the word
`online` or time in format HH:MM:SS (if NTP is available and KWLConfig::HeartbeatTimestamp
is set to true).

If the connection to the broker breaks, a will message with value `offline` will
be left at the broker, so attached clients can react to the event.


## Status Bits

Status bits in form of a hexadecimal number `0xEEEEIIVV` indicate the overall status
of the system. Top 4 digits indicate error conditions, mid 2 digits indicate additional
information and lower 2 digits contain additional information value.

Error condition flags are OR-ed together to form an error status (`EEEE`):
    * 0001 - FAN1 (intake) not working
    * 0002 - FAN2 (exhaust) not working
    * 0004 - crash presence bit (see Programming/CrashDebugging.md)
    * 0008 - NTP time not yet synchronized or NTP server not answering
    * 0010 - T1 sensor (outside air) not working
    * 0020 - T2 sensor (inlet air) not working
    * 0040 - T3 sensor (outlet air) not working
    * 0080 - T4 sensor (exhaust air) not working

Info messages contain info type (`II`) and info value (`VV`). Following info types
are currently defined:
    * 00 - no additional information
    * 01 - calibration in progress, value indicates which mode is being calibrated
    * 02 - antifreeze is trying to raise temperature using preheater, value indicates
           preheater strength in %
    * 03 - antifreeze turned off one or both fans, value indicates 0 only intake,
           1 also exhaust, for fireplace mode
    * 04 - summer bypass is opening (value 1) or closing (value 0)


## Sensor Values

Sensor values for FAN1, FAN2 and temperature sensors are self-explanatory.

Sensor values for DP1, DP2, DHT1, DHT2, CO2 and VOC sensors will be only communicated, if
respective sensors are actually installed.

If differential pressure sensors are installed, then they can be used for
the calibration via airflow (more exact than the calibration via fan speed
alone).


## Ventilation Mode

Current ventilation mode will be communicated upon change and periodically.


## Summer Bypass

Summer bypass state values are communicated when the state of the bypass changes and
periodically.

Summer bypass configuration is only communicated on-demand.
